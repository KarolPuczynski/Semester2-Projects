This repository contains two C++ projects developed during the second semester as part of academic coursework.

## ðŸš° Water Supply Network Generator (BFS Algorithm)

A simulation that generates a basic water supply network beetween cities using the Breadth-First Search algorithm.  
The program builds a grid-like layout representing cities connected with waterworks.
